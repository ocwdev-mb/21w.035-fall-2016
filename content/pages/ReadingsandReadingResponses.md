*   Any moment in either article that appealed to your emotions (e.g. sadness, anger, sympathy, humor)? Note: these will likely be very subtle, so pay close attention.
*   Are there any important pieces of data (i.e. evidence) that support a statement (i.e. claim) made by the author?
*   Do the authors reference or quote any expert (and share their credentials)? If so, why do you think they chose this particular person?
*   What’s the impact of these moments on you as a reader?
*   How do these instances shape your understanding of the issue? For example, do they increase or decrease the trustworthiness or persuasiveness of the information?

*   The three articles cover the same topic, yet each article is progressively specialized for a particular audience, and each is written in a different genre.
*   What are the main differences among the texts (e.g. length, organization, and word choice)?
*   Why might one genre be valued more by certain audiences, and less (or not at all) by other audiences?
*   Note: The peer-reviewed journal article is difficult to read because it’s for a specialized, expert audience. Do not try to understand all of the content, and instead focus on the form and organization.
